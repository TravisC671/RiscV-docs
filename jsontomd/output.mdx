    **pg. 106**

    ## Syntax

    `svc <syscall_number>` <br />
    **\<syscall_number\>** is encoded in the instruction. The operating system may determine which operating system service is requested

    ## Details
    In Linux, \<syscall_number\> should always just be zero. The system call number is passed in x8 and six other parameters can be passed in on x0-x5. <br />  <br /> On Linux, it is generally better to make system calls by using the corresponding C library function, rather than calling them directly from assembly. This is because the C library function may perform additional work before or after making the system call. For instance, the exit library function may invoke other functions to cleanly shut down the program before it performs the exit system call.
